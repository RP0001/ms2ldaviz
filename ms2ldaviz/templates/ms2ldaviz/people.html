        Simon is a <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/">a senior lecturer</a>  in the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>
        at the University of Glasgow.
        His research interest involves the development of Machine Learning and Statistical techniques to
        help with the analysis of complex datasets, particularly within the field of Metabolomics but also
        other -omics fields, Human-Computer Interaction and Information Retrieval.
        His metabolomics work is done in collaboration with many people, particularly
        <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow Polyomics</a> (of which he's an affiliate member).

        Justin is <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/biog-JustinvanderHooft.html">a mass spectrometry technologist</a>
        at <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow Polyomics</a>, University of Glasgow.
        Justin conducted his thesis at <a href="http://www.wur.nl/en.htm">Wageningen University</a>, The Netherlands, where he developed his interests in systematic metabolite identification and annotation, and his fascination for the unravelling of complex biological extracts.
        In the MS2LDA project, Justin provides valuable biological data interpretations and insights that is crucial to the development of the system.

        Joe is a <a href="https://github.com/joewandy">data scientist</a>
        at <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow Polyomics</a>, University of Glasgow. Before employed at Glasgow Polyomics, Joe was a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>, supervised by Simon.
        His research interest is in natural language processing and the application of machine learning methods to the analysis of complex biological data.
        In particular, this also involves the necessary large-scale processing of data required prior to modelling and also the effective visualisations of analysis results.
