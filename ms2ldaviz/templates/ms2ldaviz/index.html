    <blockquote>
    <p>
        Tandem MS is a technique for compound identification in untargeted metabolomics
        experiments. Because of a lack of reference spectra, most molecules cannot be identified, and many
        spectra cannot be used. We present MS2LDA, an unsupervised method (inspired by text-mining) that
        extracts common patterns of mass fragments and neutral losses—Mass2Motifs—from collections of
        fragmentation spectra. Structurally characterized Mass2Motifs can be used to annotate molecules
        for which no reference spectra exist and expose biochemical relationships between molecules.
        For four beer extracts, without training data, we show that, with 30 structurally characterized
        Mass2Motifs, we can annotate approximately three times as many molecules as with library matching.
        These Mass2Motifs were validated in reference spectra from Global Natural Products Social Molecular
        Networking (GNPS) and MassBank.

        <b>How does it work?</b> In MS2LDA, discrete fragment and neutral loss features are extracted from fragmentation spectra. Related features that tend to co-occur are detected using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> model.
        The figure below shows the analogy between LDA for text and MS2LDA for fragment and neutral loss features. LDA finds topics interpreted as ‘football related’, ‘business-related’ and ‘environment related’. MS2LDA finds sets of concurring mass fragments or losses (Mass2Motifs) that can be interpreted as ‘Asparagine-related’, ‘Hexose-related’ and ‘Adenine-related’.
