    <h4>Ms2lda.org provides a platform to:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>perform unsupervised substructure discovery in fragmentation experiments</li>
        <li>decompose fragmentation experiments into characterized substructures (Mass2Motifs) found in MS/MS spectra of reference compounds</li>
        <li>integrate fragmentation analysis with comparative metabolomics experiments</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The tool currently accepts the fragmentation experiments in .mzML and .MSP formats and optionally an MS1 peak list can be added to which the MS1 peaks found in the fragmentation experiment are then matched prior to running LDA or Decomposition.
    </p>

    <h4>Ms2lda.org provdes access to the LDA and Decomposition models and includes the following visualisation features:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network display of discovered substructures (Mass2Motifs) and fragmented molecules</li>
        <li>Mass2Motif pages with spectra of fragmented molecules and characteristic fragment/loss features</li>
        <li>Parent pages displaying all Mass2Motifs found in fragmentation spectra</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ms2lda.org facilitates integration with metabolomics experiments by:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Mapping fold changes onto fragmented molecules</li>
        <li>Computing differentially expressed Mass2Motifs</li>
        <li>Highlighting changing molecules and differential Mass2Motifs in the network display</li>
    </ul>

        An new version of MS2LDA that allows for topics (i.e. Mass2Motifs) to be inferred across multiple document collections (i.e. fragmentation files) at once
        can be found at <a href="http://github.com/sdrogers/lda">http://github.com/sdrogers/lda</a>.
        The rest of the pipeline codes to process and load fragmentation data into the pipeline can also be found there.
        The codes for this website itself, alongside various visualisation modules, can be found at <a href="http://github.com/sdrogers/ms2ldaviz">http://github.com/sdrogers/ms2ldaviz</a>

        <b>How does it work?</b> In MS2LDA, discrete fragment and neutral loss features are extracted from fragmentation spectra. Related features that tend to co-occur are detected using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> model.
        The figure below shows the analogy between LDA for text and MS2LDA for fragment and neutral loss features. LDA finds topics interpreted as ‘football related’, ‘business-related’ and ‘environment related’. MS2LDA finds sets of concurring mass fragments or losses (Mass2Motifs) that can be interpreted as ‘Asparagine-related’, ‘Hexose-related’ and ‘Adenine-related’.
