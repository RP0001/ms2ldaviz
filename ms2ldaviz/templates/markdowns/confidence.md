#### Structural Characterization Confidence Levels
 
Given that i) no complete metabolites are structurally elucidates, but mass spectrometry detectable substructures or structural features, and ii) the confidence levels as proposed by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, the MassBank consortium, and others were used as blueprint, the following structural characterization confidence levels are proposed when communicating Mass2Motifs in databases:  

- **Level 3A**: Several mass fragments or neutral losses containing one or more specific mass values that can only point to a one specific substructure or structural feature.
- **Level 3B**: Several isomers are possible â€“ this is often a match based on elemental formula (EF) for one specific mass fragments or neutral loss.
- **Level 3C**: Mass2Motif with a consistent presence of mass fragment(s) or neutral loss(es) which enables structural classification of associated molecules but no specific structure can be assigned. These are often combinations of generic fragments or losses that have multiple possible structural confirmations
- **Level 4**: Mass2Motif with a consistent presence of mass fragment(s) or neutral loss(es) for which at the time of its discovery no structural characterization can be made.
